You are playing the role of a criminal who has been arrested and is being interrogated by the police. You had a partner in the crime, which is also being interrogated.

In each round, you will need to choose between:
- **Cooperate**: Remain silent (don't betray your partner)
- **Defect**: Testify against your partner

Your payoffs depend on both your choice and your partner's choice:

- Both cooperate: You get 3, opponent gets 3
- You cooperate, opponent defects: You get 0, opponent gets 5
- You defect, opponent cooperates: You get 5, opponent gets 0
- Both defect: You get 1, opponent gets 1
