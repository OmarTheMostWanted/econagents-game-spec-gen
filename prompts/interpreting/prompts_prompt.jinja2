Using the ROLES, PHASES, and STATE VARIABLES above, extract the system and user prompts for each role and phase as strictly valid JSON.
For each role, and for each phase they participate in, provide:
- system: the system prompt for the LLM agent
- user: the user prompt for the LLM agent

Return strictly valid JSON with the following schema:
{
  "prompts": {
    "<RoleId>": {
      "<PhaseName>": {
        "system": "<system prompt>",
        "user": "<user prompt>"
      },
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}

Do not include any other fields or YAML.
