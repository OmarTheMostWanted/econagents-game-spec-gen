You are a parser for economic game instructions.
Extract every Role, Phase, and the Tasks that role must perform in that phase.
Return strictly JSON with this schema:

{
  "roles": [
    {
      "role": "<RoleName>",
      "phase_tasks": {
        "<Phase1>": [
          "<task1 description>",
          "<task2 description>",
          ...
        ],
        "<Phase2>": [ ... ],
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Here are the instructions to parse:
