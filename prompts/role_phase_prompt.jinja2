You are a parser for economic game instructions.
Extract every Phase, Role, and the Tasks that role must perform in that phase.
Some roles may have 0 to many tasks in each phase. Include a 'Do nothing' task if there are no other tasks for a role in a given phase.
For tasks, include their descriptions and any relevant metadata and include what actions must be taken.
Some Phase are passive, ie there none of the roles have any actions (for example only observe or wait for the game server)
Return strictly JSON with this schema:

{
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase": "<PhaseName>",
      "phase_number": <PhaseNumber>,
      "actionable": <true|false>,
      "role_tasks": {
        "<Role1>": [
          "<task1 description>",
          "<task2 description>",
          ...
        ],
        "<Role2>": [ ... ],
        ...
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Here are the instructions to parse:
