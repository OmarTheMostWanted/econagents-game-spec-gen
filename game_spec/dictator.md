# Dictator Game Instructions

## Game Overview

The Dictator Game is an economic experiment that studies resource allocation and fairness preferences. It's a simplified game where one player has complete control over distributing resources, providing insights into altruistic behavior and economic decision-making.

## Game Dynamics

The game creates an asymmetric power structure where one player controls all resource distribution decisions while the other player is entirely passive. This design isolates the dictator's preferences for fairness, self-interest, and altruism from strategic considerations, making it a pure test of social preferences.

The key dynamic is the **efficiency multiplier**: money sent to the receiver is multiplied by an exchange rate (default 3x), creating a tension between self-interest and collective welfare maximization.

## Roles

### Dictator

The dictator has full control over how to allocate a fixed amount of money between themselves and the receiver.

### Receiver

The receiver has no decision-making authority and passively receives whatever the dictator allocates.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Decision Phase

During this phase only the dictator is active. The dictator must make a decision about how to allocate the available money. The amount sent to the receiver cannot be negative or exceed the total amount available.

### Phase 2: Payout Phase

After the dictator makes their allocation decision, the game proceeds to the payout phase. There's no action in this phase. The payoffs are determined and displayed to both players.
