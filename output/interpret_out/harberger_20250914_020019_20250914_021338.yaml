    Presentation:
      system: You are a Developer in a spatial planning experiment. Your role is to
        determine project outcomes and pay tax on declared property value. In the
        current phase, 'Presentation', your task is to view your role and land layout
        on the screen.
      user: Make sure to examine your role and the layout of the land displayed on
        the screen.
    Declaration:
      system: You are a Developer in a spatial planning experiment tasked with submitting
        an initial declaration of your property's value under both 'Project' and 'No
        Project' outcomes.
      user: Submit your initial declaration for property value for both 'Project'
        and 'No Project' conditions.

      user: Review the results of the round, including your points and total earnings.
  '2':
    Presentation:
      system: You are an Owner in a spatial planning experiment. Your role involves
        owning land and participating in declarations and speculations based on project
        outcomes. In the 'Presentation' phase, observe your role, the layout of the
        land, and the value ranges.
      user: Carefully view your role, the layout of the land, and the value ranges
        displayed on the screen.
    Declaration:
      system: You are an Owner tasked with submitting an initial declaration of your

        decisions and tax implications.
      user: Provide your initial declaration for property value for 'Project' and
        'No Project' conditions.
    Speculation:
      system: As an Owner in the 'Speculation' phase, observe speculators who may
        buy plots based on initial declarations and the chosen project condition.
      user: Watch how speculators might choose to buy plots including yours based
        on the declarations.
    Market:
      system: You are in the 'Market' phase as an Owner. Here, you can trade tax shares

      user: Observe speculator actions as they choose whether to buy land based on
        final declared values.
    Results:

      user: Examine the results of the round, noting your points and total earnings.
  '3':
    Presentation:
      system: You are a Speculator in a spatial planning experiment. Your role is
        to buy and sell land plots during speculation phases. In 'Presentation', familiarize
        yourself with your role and the layout of the land.
      user: Assess your role and the land layout on the screen.

  title: Spatial Planning Experiment
  instructions: Welcome to the lab, and thank you for participating in today’s experiment.
    Please place all your personal belongings away and switch off your phones and
    other mobile devices so we can have your complete attention. DO NOT socialize
    or talk during the experiment. It is very important that you do not touch the
    computer until you are instructed to do so. When you are told to use the computer,
    please use it only as instructed. In particular, do not attempt to browse the
    web or use programs unrelated to the experiment. The experiment you participate
    in today is an experiment in spatial planning, where you and other participants
    determine whether a Project gets developed or not. At the end of the experiment,
    you are paid for your participation in cash. Each of you may earn different amounts.
    The amount you earn depends on your decisions, chance, and others’ decisions.
    You will be using the computer for the entire experiment, and all interaction
    between you and others will be through computer terminals. You will interact anonymously
    and your decisions will only be stored together with your random ID number. Your
    name will not be made public, neither today nor in the future.
